### **User Journey: Forklift Operator**

**User**: John, a forklift operator at a busy warehouse.

**Goal**: Complete his pre-operational safety check before starting his shift.

**The Journey:**

1. **Preparation**: John arrives for his shift. He opens the SafeWork app on his company-issued device (a ruggedized smartphone or tablet).  
2. **Asset Identification**: John finds his assigned forklift. He uses the SafeWork app's scanner to read the unique QR code on the forklift.  
3. **Checklist Load**: The app instantly recognizes the forklift and loads the correct pre-operational checklist.  
4. **Inspection**: John goes through the checklist, item by item. He confirms things like "Tire pressure is good," "Forklift lights are working," etc.  
5. **Issue Reporting**: As he's checking the tires, he notices a small tear in the sidewall. He flags the item on his checklist as "failed." The app prompts him to add details. He takes a photo of the tear and adds a quick note: "Tear in front-left tire."  
6. **Submission**: He completes the rest of the checklist. The app shows all items are checked, and he taps "Submit." Because of the offline-first feature, he can still submit the report even if there's no Wi-Fi in that part of the warehouse.  
7. **Data Sync**: Once John's device reconnects to a network (either in a different part of the warehouse or when he returns to the office), the report is automatically synced to the main SafeWork dashboard.

### **Admin & Maintenance Team Journey**

**User**: Sarah, a maintenance supervisor at the same warehouse.

**Goal**: Respond to and manage incoming issues and ensure they're resolved efficiently.

**The Journey:**

1. **Notification & Dashboard Alert**: Sarah is at her desk and gets a real-time notification on her computer and mobile device. The SafeWork dashboard shows a new "urgent" issue flagged by John on Forklift \#12. The dashboard's status for that forklift changes from green to red.  
2. **Reviewing the Issue**: Sarah clicks on the notification. She sees the full report from John: the "failed" checklist item, the photo of the tire tear, and his note. She can also see a full history of all inspections on that forklift.  
3. **Task Creation**: Sarah immediately creates a "Work Order" or "Task" from the issue report. The system automatically populates the details (asset ID, issue description, photos, etc.). She assigns the task to Mike, a maintenance technician on her team. She sets a priority level ("High") and a due date.  
4. **Task Assignment & Notification**: The system sends a push notification to Mike's device, letting him know he has a new task assigned.  
5. **Tracking & Follow-up**: From her dashboard, Sarah can now track the status of the task. She can see when Mike views the task, when he starts working on it, and when he marks it as complete. She can also add comments to the task to communicate with Mike directly.  
6. **Resolution & Reporting**: Once Mike completes the repair and marks the task as "Resolved," Sarah can review his notes and then "close" the original issue report. The system now has a complete record of the issue from start to finish.

This journey highlights the value of the platform for the management side of the business—turning a simple report into a streamlined workflow.

### **Analytics & Reporting Features**

**Safety & Compliance Scorecard**: A high-level dashboard that provides a real-time "score" for the business's overall safety and compliance. It could track:

* **Inspection Completion Rate**: How many checklists are being completed on time versus those that are missed?  
* **Outstanding Issues**: A count of all open issues, broken down by priority (High, Medium, Low).  
* **Mean Time to Resolve**: The average time it takes for an issue to go from being reported to being closed out.

**Asset Health and Performance**: This report would be all about the equipment. It could show:

* **Top 5 Assets with the Most Issues**: Identifying which machines are a maintenance nightmare.  
* **Issue Trend Analysis**: A graph showing how issues with a specific asset have changed over time. Are things getting better or worse?  
* **Service History**: A full, digital logbook for each asset, showing every inspection, issue, and corrective action.

**Team Performance & Engagement**: This dashboard would focus on the human element. It could provide:

* **Top Inspectors/Reporters**: Who are the most active and diligent users? This can encourage a culture of accountability.  
* **Common Issues by Team/Location**: Identifying which teams or factory floors are experiencing the most problems, which could point to a need for more training or new equipment.

* **Unlimited Data History**: Ensure the database can handle and store unlimited data and evidence for the premium plan.

### **Technical Deep Dive: Version-Based Synchronization**

To make this work seamlessly, you'll need to implement a few key mechanisms:

#### **On the Server Side**

* **Version Tracking**: Every record in your database (e.g., each asset, each inspection report, each checklist) needs a `version` field. This could be a simple integer that increments on every update, or a timestamp. Let's say you use an integer, and it starts at 1\.  
* **API Logic**: Your API endpoints for updating data will need to be smart. When the mobile app sends an update, it will include the version number of the record it's trying to change. The server's logic would be:  
  * **IF** the version number sent by the app **matches** the current version on the server, update the record and increment the server's version number.  
  * **ELSE** (if the versions don't match), a conflict has occurred.

#### **On the Client (Mobile App) Side**

* **Version Storage**: The local database on the app will need to store the `version` number for every record it holds.  
* **Sync Logic**: The app's synchronization process will be more sophisticated. It won't just send data; it will send the data along with its corresponding version numbers. The app would also regularly pull down updates from the server, checking for newer versions of records.  
* **Conflict Handling**: When the server detects a conflict, it will respond with an error. The app then needs to deal with this conflict.

#### **Conflict Resolution Strategies**

Since you're using a version-based approach, you can program how to handle a conflict when it happens. Let's brainstorm two options:

1. **User-driven Resolution**: The app could show a message to the user, like "A new version of this checklist exists. Do you want to overwrite your changes or discard them?" This puts the power in the user's hands but can interrupt their workflow.

### **SafeWork Backend API Features**

#### **1\. Authentication & Authorization**

This is the foundation. The API needs a way to verify who a user is and what they are allowed to do.

* **User Registration & Login**: Endpoints for creating new users and for users to log in.  
* **Token Management**: A system to issue and validate secure tokens (like JWTs) for every API request.  
* **Permissions**: An endpoint to check a user's role (`admin`, `inspector`, etc.) and grant access to specific data and functions.

#### **2\. User & Asset Management**

These endpoints allow admins to manage the people and things in the system.

* **Users**:  
  * `POST /users`: Create a new user account.  
  * `GET /users`: List all users.  
  * `PUT /users/{id}`: Update a user's details.  
  * `DELETE /users/{id}`: Archive or delete a user.  
* **Assets**:  
  * `POST /assets`: Create a new asset, including its QR code ID.  
  * `GET /assets`: List all assets.  
  * `GET /assets/{id}`: Get details for a specific asset.

#### **3\. Core Operations (The Heart of the API)**

This is where the magic happens. All of these endpoints must handle the `version` number for your synchronization strategy.

* **Checklists**:  
  * `POST /checklists`: Create a new checklist (for admins).  
  * `GET /checklists`: List all available checklists.  
  * `PUT /checklists/{id}`: Update a checklist, incrementing the version number.  
* **Inspections**:  
  * `POST /inspections`: Submit a completed inspection from the mobile app, including the version of the checklist used.  
  * `GET /inspections/{id}`: Retrieve a specific inspection report.  
* **Issues & Tasks**:  
  * `POST /issues`: Create a new issue report (from an inspection or manually).  
  * `GET /issues`: List all open or resolved issues.  
  * `PUT /tasks/{id}`: Update the status of a task (e.g., mark as "in progress" or "resolved").

#### **4\. Analytics & Reporting**

These endpoints will power your beautiful dashboard.

* `GET /analytics/completion-rate`: Get the inspection completion rate over time.  
* `GET /analytics/top-issues`: Get a list of the most common issues reported.  
* `GET /analytics/asset-history/{id}`: Retrieve a full history of inspections and issues for a specific asset.
