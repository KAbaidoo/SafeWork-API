## **Product Requirements Document (PRD): SafeWork**

### **1\. Introduction**

#### **1.1. Project Overview**

SafeWork is a mobile-first operations platform designed to help small and medium-sized businesses manage safety, compliance, and asset maintenance. The product aims to move companies from a reactive to a proactive safety culture by providing tools for inspection management, real-time issue reporting, and powerful analytics.

#### **1.2. Problem Statement**

Many businesses lack a simple, accessible system to track and manage physical assets, conduct inspections, and ensure compliance. This often leads to manual, paper-based processes that are inefficient, prone to human error, and fail to provide actionable data, resulting in increased safety risks and maintenance costs.

#### **1.3. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**

SafeWork's core strengths are its **simplicity** and its **offline mobile-first functionality**. The app is built to be intuitive and reliable, ensuring frontline workers can use it anywhere, even without an internet connection. This is complemented by a powerful web dashboard for management, creating a seamless and comprehensive solution.

* **Supervisors**: Managers who review inspection reports, assign tasks, and track issues.  
* **Administrators**: Company leaders who use analytics to inform business decisions.

#### **2.2. Business Model & Pricing**

SafeWork will use a tiered pricing model with three plans to serve a wide range of customers.

### **3\. Key Features & User Journeys**

#### **3.1. Core Features**

* **Mobile App**: Offline-first functionality, QR code scanning for assets, customizable checklists, and real-time issue reporting with photos.  
* **Web Dashboard**: User and asset management, task assignment, and real-time analytics.  
* **API**: A version-based API that serves as a single source of truth for both mobile and web clients, handling all data synchronization.

#### **3.2. User Stories**

* **Forklift Operator**: "As a forklift operator, I want to scan a QR code to pull up a pre-operational checklist so I can quickly complete my safety inspection and report issues before starting my shift."  
* **Maintenance Supervisor**: "As a maintenance supervisor, I want to receive real-time notifications about new issues so I can review the report and assign a task to a technician immediately."

### **4\. Development Roadmap**

#### **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

The focus is on delivering the core user journey.

* **Mobile App**: Implement user authentication, QR code scanning, and the offline checklist completion process.  
* **Web Dashboard**: Build basic user/asset management and an issue viewer.  
* **Backend**: Create the core API endpoints for checklists, inspections, and issues, with a focus on implementing the **version-based synchronization logic**.

#### **Phase 2: Core Product Enhancements**

This phase will build out the features that drive upgrades to the Premium plan.

* **Customization**: Enable admins to create and manage custom inspection templates.  
* **Workflows**: Introduce real-time notifications and a robust task management system.  
* **Analytics**: Implement basic dashboards for inspection completion rates and top-reported issues.

#### **Phase 3: Enterprise Features**

This final phase will add high-value features for the Enterprise tier.

* **Security & Integrations**: Build SSO/SCIM functionality and API access for custom integrations.  
* **Advanced Analytics**: Develop sophisticated reporting for trend analysis and asset performance.  
* **Telematics**: Integrate with real-time data from assets to enable predictive maintenance alerts.

### **5\. Technical Requirements**

#### **5.1. Backend API**

The API will be a separate repository and the central hub for the platform. Key endpoints include:

* **Auth**: User login and token management.  
* **Assets**: CRUD operations for managing assets and their data.  
* **Core**: Endpoints for checklists, inspections, and issue reports. All of these will include a version field to support conflict resolution.  
* **Analytics**: Endpoints to power the dashboard with key metrics.

#### **5.2. Synchronization Strategy**

SafeWork will use a **version-based synchronization** approach. This means every record will have a version number. When the app syncs, if there is a conflict, the system will prompt the user to decide whether to overwrite their changes or accept the server's updated data.
