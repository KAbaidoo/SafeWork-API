# **Project Brief: SafeWork**

## **1\. Product Overview**

**SafeWork** is a mobile-first software-as-a-service (SaaS) product designed to help small and medium-sized businesses improve safety, compliance, and operational efficiency. The platform allows organizations to manage and track assets, carry out inspections, report issues in real-time, and document corrective actions. The ultimate goal is to help companies shift from a reactive to a proactive maintenance and safety culture.

## **2\. Unique Selling Proposition (USP)**

SafeWork's core differentiators are **simplicity**, an **offline mobile-first approach**, and **customization**. The app is built to be intuitive and user-friendly, ensuring that frontline workers in any location can use it effortlessly, even in environments with no internet connectivity. The platform also offers customizable checklists and a library of industry-standard templates (e.g., NEBOSH, ISO), making it adaptable to any business's unique needs.

## **3\. Target Audience**

The product will target small to medium-sized businesses (10+ users) in industries that require robust safety and compliance protocols. This includes:

* Manufacturing and Production  
* Logistics and Warehousing  
* Construction  
* Field Services and Maintenance

## **4\. Core Features**

### **Mobile Application**

* **Offline Functionality**: The app works fully offline and syncs data to the server once a connection is re-established.  
* **Asset Management**: Users can scan QR codes on assets to quickly access and complete pre-operational checklists.  
* **Inspections & Checklists**: Users can go through customizable checklists and record data, adding photos and notes as needed.

* **User-driven Conflict Resolution**: The app prompts the user to resolve data conflicts that occur during synchronization, preventing data loss.

### **Admin Dashboard (Web)**

## **6\. User Journeys**

* **Forklift Operator**: Arrives at work, scans a QR code on a forklift, and completes the pre-operational checklist. If an issue is found, they flag it and take a photo. Once a connection is available, the report is synced to the server.  
* **Maintenance Supervisor**: Receives a real-time notification on their dashboard about the flagged issue. They review the details and photos, assign a task to a maintenance technician, and track the issue through to its resolution.

## **7\. Development Roadmap**

### **Phase 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**

Focus on the core user journey: offline mobile checklist completion and basic issue reporting. The backend will support user/asset management and a simple issue viewer. The free plan will be implemented in this phase.

### **Phase 2: Core Product & Freemium Enhancements**

Add features that drive adoption and upgrades: checklist customization, real-time notifications, task management, basic analytics, and user roles.

### **Phase 3: The Enterprise Powerhouse**

Build the high-value features that justify the premium plan, including advanced analytics, integrations, SSO, and automated maintenance triggered by telematic data.

### **Key Technical Decision**

The system will use a **version-based synchronization** strategy between the mobile app and the server. When a conflict occurs during syncing, the app will prompt the user to make a choice, ensuring data integrity.

## **8\. Backend/API Features**

The API will be the central hub for all data, supporting both the mobile app and the web dashboard.

* **Authentication**: Endpoints for user login, token management, and permission checks.  
* **Asset Management**: CRUD operations for managing assets and their data.  
* **Core Operations**: API endpoints for creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting checklists, inspections, and issue reports. Each endpoint will handle the **version field** for synchronization.  
* **Analytics**: Endpoints to power the dashboard with data on inspection completion rates, common issues, and asset history.
